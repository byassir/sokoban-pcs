This is a C++ implementation of a basic Sokoban solver. To search for solutions it uses BFS over a search tree consisting of possible board configurations. The interest of this project is not to explore the complex pruning techniques that can be implemented, but how parallelism can make this algorithm run faster. Therefore, not too many pruning techniques were implemented, but a basic sequential and two parallel implementations are given.
